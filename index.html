        What is a virtual influencer
      </h2>
      <p>Definition from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_influencer">here</a>.</p>
      <p>
        <em>A virtual influencer, at times described as a virtual persona or virtual model, is a computer-generated fictional character that can be used for a variety of marketing-related purposes, but most frequently for social media marketing, in lieu of human "influencers". Most virtual influencers are designed using computer graphics and motion capture technology to resemble real people in realistic situations. Common derivatives of virtual influencers include VTubers, which broadly refer to online entertainers and YouTubers who represent themselves using virtual avatars instead of their physical selves.</em>

        History
      </h2>
      <p>
        <em>Virtual influencers are fundamentally synonymous with virtual idols, which originate from Japan's anime and Japanese idol culture that dates back to the 1980s. The first virtual idol created was Lynn Minmay, a fictional singer and main character of the anime television series Super Dimension Fortress Macross (1982) and the animated film adaptation Macross: Do You Remember Love? (1984). Minmay's success led to the production of more Japanese virtual idols, such as EVE from the Japanese cyberpunk anime Megazone 23 (1985), and Sharon Apple in Macross Plus (1994). Virtual idols were not always well received – in 1995, Japanese talent agency Horipro created Kyoko Date, which was inspired by the Macross franchise and dating sim games such as Tokimeki Memorial (1994). Date failed to gain commercial success despite drawing headlines for her debut as a CGI idol, largely due to technical limitations leading to issues such as unnatural movements, an issue also known as the uncanny valley.
          Since their inception, many virtual idols created have achieved continual success, with notable names including the Vocaloid singer Hatsune Miku, and the virtual YouTuber Kizuna AI. Technological advancements have also enabled production teams to use artificial intelligence and advanced techniques to customize the personalities and behavior of virtual idols.</em>

      <h2>
        WHAT ARE THE MAIN PROS OF VIRTUAL INFLUENCERS? WHY DID THEY BECOME SO POPULAR?
      </h2>
      <p>Original interview can be found <a href="https://ffface.me/media/why-virtual-influencers-are-here-to-stay/#:~:text=WHY%20DID%20THEY%20BECOME%20SO,just%20to%20show%20their%20hate.">here</a>.</p>
      <p>
        Virtual influencers became so popular because they’re original and drawing attention to themselves. Some people love it, and repost them. On the other hand, some people hate them, but still share information as well, just to show their hate. A lot of people were not able to be neutral about virtual influencers, and it’s a key. Most of the audience shows at least some reaction and it helps in organical promotion.
          In my opinion the main benefit of virtual influencers for brands is their flexibility. Their total flexibility in terms of fulfilling goals and tasks of the brand. Virtual influencers can’t be sick, they can’t be in a bad mood, and they can’t do technical tasks wrong because they’re under total control. So, for the brand, virtual influencers have two main benefits: first of all, total control, and the second one is that they get more attention. According to recent reports from HypeAuditor, virtual influencers have three times more engagement than real-life influencers with the same size of the audience.

      <h2>
        ARE VIRTUAL INFLUENCERS A GREAT FIT FOR ANY BRAND? OR ARE THERE ANY SPECIFIC BRAND CATEGORIES, LIKE FASHION, BEAUTY, OR ANYTHING ELSE THAT WORK BETTER WITH VIRTUAL INFLUENCERS?
      </h2>
      <p>
        I believe that virtual influencers are similar to regular influencers, that means they can work for any category. I can imagine political virtual influencers, or virtual influencers that review some new gadgets and devices, or share some tips on musical playlists. However, we need to acknowledge that in terms of virtual influencers, the visual part is very important. Visual part is something that usually makes a difference. Virtual influencers are more efficient in promoting visual products, like fashion or beauty products. In that case, the product will be in the focus along with other parts of the visual.

      <h2>
        THERE ARE MANY COMMUNICATION CHANNELS AND INSTRUMENTS THAT BRANDS CAN USE. WHEN ARE VIRTUAL INFLUENCERS THE BEST CHOICE? WHAT ARE THE COMMUNICATION GOALS THAT THEY CAN HELP WITH BEST?
      </h2>
      <p>
        I believe that virtual influencers can work within all communication ecosystems. Virtual influencers can be perceived in two ways: first, is a new anthropomorphic brand media that can own different social networks, and that can work within different social media. And second, is that a virtual influencer can be a brand`s mascot. That is why it can be present in outdoor advertising and in-store, on-trade, and off-trade promotion. So, from my perspective, to sum up, virtual influencers can be a part of the communication on all channels, similar to regular influencers.<br>
I also believe that they can generate both: awareness and conversions, if they engage users in conversions. For example, we can launch a promo with a virtual influencer, where they will be a part of the mood board, or we can launch a promo on Instagram, where they will review the product, and announce the promo which will allow users to receive something in exchange for an action. A virtual influencer can suggest people to watch a video, tap on the link, fill out the form, receive a discount or go to an offline store to make a purchase. In terms of communication goals and communication types, virtual influencers can do pretty much anything real-life influencers can do.

      <h2>
        WHAT ARE YOUR TOP-3 TIPS FOR BRANDS WHO WANT TO COLLABORATE WITH AN EXISTING VIRTUAL INFLUENCER?
      </h2>
      <p>
        Regarding tips for brands that want to start working with virtual influencers, I would say they can use the same tips that they use with regular influencers. First of all, an influencer should be relevant. The fact that the influencer is virtual is not enough for the communication to be successful. So the story behind this virtual influencer should correspond with the story of the selected communication platform that you’re having with your brand right now.<br>
The second tip: even though it’s a virtual influencer, your communication should still look organic. Giving your product to an influencer, taking a couple of photos, and saying it’s working is not enough. No, you should come up with some story. For example, in terms of our collaboration with a Bird app, an app that helps people to find apartments, we integrated the whole thing into the story of our virtual influencer Astra. When she moved to Ukraine, she was living in a hotel, and at some point, she decided to find a new apartment to rent. So she used the Bird app and she found the apartment and organically showed the whole process of how it happened. Also, we made it even more organic, because before the launch of this communication we made a survey among the Astra subscribers, and we asked them: «Okay, guys, how do you find an apartment nowadays?». And most of the followers answered that it was through the Bird app. So, we made a pre-communication, we showcased the process of using this product, and then we showed the result, which was Astra being in a new beautiful apartment.<br>
Third tip: you have to try to make this partnership long-term. Because a single communication, even with real-life influencers, is not efficient. We all know that it’s not about the number of contacts with the audience, it’s about the quantity of these contacts with each consumer. So, you have to create a long-term plan of how you will work with these virtual influencers during different seasons and occasions.

        BALMAIN: “Virtual Army”
      </h2>
      <p>
        Balmain has introduced a new gang of supermodels—but, they're not real. This season, creative director Olivier Rousteing has opted for a "virtual army" of digitally manufactured models to wear his newest collection.
"Anyone and everyone is always welcome to join Balmain army's growing ranks — they need only share our bold spirit of adventure as our new virtual icons, Margot, Shudu and Zhi who mirror the beauty, the rock style and the confident power," says Balmain's official website.
Balmain's Rousteing is known for his edgy style and focus on bringing the French fashion house to the forefront of the digital age. "We need to change. We need to push boundaries. We need to talk to the new generation. We need to make fashion relevant," he said in a video for the New York Times last year.
Earlier this year, Rousteing created "My City of Lights," which is a virtual reality experience and headset to help people understand his creative process. In a promo video for Balmain, he says he wanted to help "bridge the gap between fashion and technology."

  <h2>Introduction</h2>

  <p>What is a Virtual Influencer? Why are they becoming so popular? Ordinarily information storage and retrieval 
    systems have been concerned with text and text-like records (e.g., names, numbers, and alphanumeric codes). 
    The present interest in “multimedia” reminds us that not all phenomena of interest in information science are 
    textual or textlike. We may need to deal with any phenomena that someone may wish to observe: Events, processes, 
    images, and objects as well as texts.</p>

  </figure>

  <p>This article reconstructs and comments on the development of thought on this topic with an emphasis on the ideas of continental European documentalists in the first half of this century. If “documentation” (a term that included information storage and retrieval systems) is what you do to or with documents, how far could you push the meaning of “document” and what were the limits to “documentation”? The work of European pioneers such as Paul Otlet and Suzanne Briet has received renewed attention in recent years and has been related to discussion of physical forms of “information”.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> These issues are important because mechanical information systems can only operate on physical representations of “information.” This background is relevant to the clarification of the nature and scope of information systems.</p>

  <h2>From Document to “Documentation”</h2>

  <p>In the late 19th century, there was increasing concern with the rapid increase in the number of publications, especially of scientific and technical literature. Continued effectiveness in the creation, dissemination, and utilization of recorded knowledge was seen as needing new techniques for managing the growing literature.</p>

  <p>The “managing” that was needed had several aspects. Efficient and reliable techniques were needed for collecting, preserving, organizing (arranging), representing (describing), selecting (retrieving), reproducing (copying), and disseminating documents. The traditional term for this activity was “bibliography.” However, “bibliography” was not entirely satisfactory for two reasons: (i) It was felt that something more than traditional “bibliography” was needed, e.g., techniques for reproducing documents; and (ii) “bibliography” also had other well-established meanings, especially historical (or analytical) bibliography, which is concerned with traditional techniques of book production.</p>

  <p>Early in the 20th century, the word “documentation” was increasingly adopted in Europe instead of “bibliography” to denote the set of techniques needed to manage this explosion of documents. Woledge (1983) provides a detailed account of the evolving usage of “documentation” and related words in English, French, and German. From about 1920, “documentation” was increasingly accepted as a general term to encompass bibliography, scholarly information services,<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> records management, and archival work.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup></p>

  <p>There are numerous writings on the definition, scope, and nature of “documentation,” much of it concerned with the relationships between documentation, bibliography, and librarianship. Unfortunately, much of this literature, like much of the later discussion of information science and librarianship, is undermined by the authors’ attempts to create or amplify distinctions where the differences are not really fundamental but, rather, a matter of emphasis.</p>

  <p>Loosjes<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> explained documentation in historical terms: Systematic access to written texts, he wrote, became more difficult after the invention of printing resulted in the proliferation of texts; scholars were increasingly obliged to delegate tasks to specialists; assembling and maintaining collections was the field of librarianship; bibliography was concerned with the descriptions of documents; the delegated task of creating access for scholars to the topical contents of documents, especially of parts within printed documents and without limitation to particular collections, was documentation.</p>

  <p>After about 1950, more elaborate terminology, such as “information science,” “information storage and retrieval,” and “information management,” increasing replaced the word “documentation.”</p>

  <h2>From Documentation Back to “Document”</h2>

  <p>The problems created by the increase in printed documents led to development of the techniques of documentation. However, the rise of documentation led, in turn, to a new and intriguing question that received little direct attention then or since.</p>

  <p>Documentation was a set of techniques developed to manage significant (or potentially significant) documents, meaning, in practice, printed texts. But there was (and is) no theoretical reason why documentation should be limited to texts, let alone printed texts. There are many other kinds of signifying objects in addition to printed texts. <strong>And if documentation can deal with texts that are not printed, could it not also deal with documents that are not texts at all?</strong> How extensively could documentation be applied? Stated differently, if the term “document” were used in a specialized meaning as the technical term to denote the objects to which the techniques of documentation could be applied, how far could the scope of documentation be extended. What could (or could not) be a document? The question was, however, rarely formulated in these terms.</p>

  <p>An early development was to extend the notion of document beyond written texts, a usage to be found in major English and French dictionaries.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> “Any expression of human thought” was a frequently used definition of “document” among documentalists. In the U.S.A., the phrases “the graphic record” and “the generic book” were widely used. This was convenient for extending the scope of the field to include pictures and other graphic and audio-visual materials. Paul Otlet (1868 – 1944), is known for his observation that documents could be three-dimensional, which enabled the inclusion of sculpture. From 1928, museum objects were likely to be included by documentalists within definitions of “document”.<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup></p>

  <p>The overwhelming practical concern of documentalists was with printed documents, so the question of how far the definition of “document” could be extended received little direct attention. Nevertheless, the occasional thoughtful writer would touch on the topic, perhaps because interested in some novel form of signifying object, such as educational toys, or because of a desire to generalize.</p>

  <h2>Paul Otlet: Objects as Documents</h2>

  <p>Otlet extended the definition of “document” halfway through his Traité de documentation of 1934. Graphic and written records are representations of ideas or of objects, he wrote, but the objects themselves can be regarded as “documents” if you are informed by observation of them. As examples of such “documents,” Otlet cites natural objects, artifacts, objects bearing traces of human activity (such as archaeological finds), explanatory models, educational games, and works of art.<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup></p>

  <p>In 1935, Walter Schürmeyer wrote: “Nowadays one understands as a document any material basis for extending our knowledge which is available for study or comparison”.<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup> Similarly, the International Institute for Intellectual Cooperation, an agency of the League of Nations, developed, in collaboration with Union Français des Organismes de Documentation, technical definitions of “document” and related technical terms in English, French, and German versions and adopted:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Document:
      <ul>
        <li>Toute base de connaissance, fixée matériellement, susceptible d’être utilisée pour consultation, étude ou preuve. Exemples: manuscrits, imprimés, représentations graphiques ou figurés, objets de collections, etc.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Document:
      <ul>
        <li>Any source of information, in material form, capable of being used for reference or study or as an authority. Examples: manuscripts, printed matter, illustrations, diagrams, museum specimens, etc.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Dokument:
      <ul>
        <li>Dokument is jeder Gegenstand, der zur Belehrung, zum Studium oder sur Beweisführung dienen kann, z.B. Handschriften, Drucke, graphische oder bildliche Darstellungen, usw.<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup></li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Suzanne Briet: Physical Evidence as Document</h2>

  <p>One individual, who had, for years, been involved in discussions of the nature of documentation and documents, addressed the extension of the meaning of “document” with unusual directness. Suzanne Briet (1894–1989), also known as Suzanne Dupuy and as Suzanne Dupuy-Briet, was active as a librarian and documentalist from 1924 to 1954.<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup></p>

  <p>In 1951, Briet published a manifesto on the nature of documentation, <em>Qu’est-ce que la documentation</em>, which starts with the assertion that “A document is evidence in support of a fact”<sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup> She then elaborates: A document is “any physical or symbolic sign, preserved or recorded, intended to represent, to reconstruct, or to demonstrate a physical or conceptual phenomenon”<sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup>. The implication is that documentation should not be viewed as being concerned with texts but with access to evidence.</p>

  <h3>The Antelope as Document</h3>

  <p>Briet<sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup> enumerates six objects and asks if each is a document.</p>

  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Object</th>
        <th>Document?</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>Star in sky</td>
        <td>No</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Photo of star</td>
        <td>Yes</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Stone in river</td>
        <td>No</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Stone in museum</td>
        <td>Yes</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Animal in wild</td>
        <td>No</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Animal in zoo</td>
        <td>Yes</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

  <p>There is discussion of an antelope. An antelope running wild on the plains of Africa should not be considered a document, she rules. But if it were to be captured, taken to a zoo and made an object of study, it has been made into a document. It has become physical evidence being used by those who study it. Not only that, but scholarly articles written about the antelope are secondary documents, since the antelope itself is the primary document.<sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup></p>

  <p>Briet’s rules for determining when an object has become a document are not made clear. We infer, however, from her discussion that:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>There is materiality: Physical objects and physical signs only;</li>
    <li>There is intentionality: It is intended that the object be treated as evidence;</li>
    <li>The objects have to be processed: They have to be made into documents; and, we think,</li>
    <li>There is a phenomenological position: The object is perceived to be a document.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>This situation is reminiscent of discussions of how an image is made art by framing it as art. Did Briet mean that just as “art” is made art by “framing” (i.e., treating) it as art, so an object becomes a “document” when it is treated as a document, i.e., as a physical or symbolic sign, preserved or recorded, intended to represent, to reconstruct, or to demonstrate a physical or conceptual phenomenon? The sources of these views are not made clear, though she does mention, in this context, her friend Raymond Bayer, a professor of philosophy at the Sorbonne, who specialized in aesthetics and phenomenology.</p>

  <p>Ron Day<sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup> has suggested, very plausibly, that Briet’s use of the word “indice” is important, that it is indexicality—the quality of having been placed in an organized, meaningful relationship with other evidence—that gives an object its documentary status.</p>

  <h2>Donker Duyvis: A Spiritual Dimension to Documents</h2>

  <p>Frits Donker Duyvis (1894–1961), who succeeded Paul Otlet as the central figure in the International Federation for Documentation, epitomized the modernist mentality of the documentalists in his dedication to the trinity of scientific management, standardization, and bibliographic control as complementary and mutually reinforcing bases for achieving progress.<sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup> Yet Donker Duyvis was not a materialist. He adopted Otlet’s view that a document was an expression of human thought, but he did so in terms of his interest in the work of Rudolf Steiner (1861–1925), founder of Anthroposophy, a spiritual movement based on the notion that there is a spiritual world comprehensible to pure thought and accessible only to the highest faculties of mental knowledge. As a result, Donker Duyvis was sensitive to what we might now call the cognitive aspects of the medium of the message. He wrote that:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>A document is the repository of an expressed thought. Consequently its contents have a spiritual character. The danger that blunt unification of the outer form exercises a repercussion on the contents in making the latter characterless and impersonal, is not illusory. . . . In standardizing the form and layout of documents it is necessary to restrict this activity to that which does not affect the spiritual contents and which serves to remove a really irrational variety.<sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup></p>
  </blockquote>

  <h2>Ranganathan: Micro-Thought on a Flat Surface</h2>

  <p>The Indian theorist S.R. Ranganathan, usually so metaphysical, took a curiously narrow and pragmatic position on the definition of “document,” resisting even the inclusion of audiovisual materials such as radio and television communications.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>But they are not documents; because they are not records on materials fit for handling or preservation. Statues, pieces of china, and the material exhibits in a museum were mentioned because they convey thought expressed in some way. But none of these is a document, since it is not a record on a more or less flat surface.<sup id="fnref:18"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">18</a></sup></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Ranganathan’s view of “document” as a synonym for “embodied micro thought” on paper “or other material, fit for physical handling, transport across space, and preservation through time” was adopted by the Indian Standards Institute (1963, p. 24), with a note explaining that the term “document” is now extended in use to include any embodied thought, micro or macro and whether the physical embodiment is exclusive to one work or is shared by more than one work.”</p>

  <p>Others, also, took a limited view of what documents were. In the U.S.A., two highly influential authors opted for a view of documents that was only an extension of textual records to include audiovisual communications. Louis Shores popularized the phrase “the generic book”<sup id="fnref:19"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">19</a></sup> and Jesse H. Shera used “the graphic record” with much the same meaning.<sup id="fnref:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup> Shera was gratuitously dismissive of Briet’s notion of documents as evidence.</p>

  <h2>Anthropology: Material Culture</h2>

  <p>Otlet was explicit that his view of “document” included archaeological finds, traces of human activity, and other objects not intended as communication.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Collections of objects brought together for purposes of preservation, science and education are essentially documentary in character (Museums and Cabinets, collections of models, specimens and samples). These collections are created from items occurring in nature rather than being delineated or described in words; they are three dimensional documents.<sup id="fnref:21"><a href="#fn:21" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">21</a></sup></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The notion of objects as documents resembles the notion of “material culture” among cultural anthropologists “for whom artifacts contributed important evidence in the documentation and interpretation of the American experience” (Ames et al., 1985, p. ix) and in museology.<sup id="fnref:22"><a href="#fn:22" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">22</a></sup></p>

  <h2>Semiotics: “Text” and “Object-as-Sign”</h2>

  <p>Briet’s ideas concerning the nature of a “document” invite discussion in relation to semiotics. In this context, we note Dufrenne’s discussion of the distinction between aesthetic objects and signifying objects:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>The function of such [signifying] objects is not to subserve some action or to satisfy some need but to dispense knowledge. We can, of course, call all objects signifying in some sense. However, we must single out those objects which do more than signify merely in order to prepare us for some action and which are not used up merely in the fulfillment of the task. Scientific texts, catechisms, photograph albums, and, on a more modest scale, signposts are all signs whose signification engages us in an activity only after having first furnished us with information.<sup id="fnref:23"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">23</a></sup></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>We can observe that by the inclusion of museum and other “found” objects, Briet’s “any physical or symbolic sign” appears to include both human signs and natural signs. Others developed the notion of “object-as-sign.” Roland Barthes, for example, in discussing “the semantics of the object,” wrote that objects</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>function as the vehicle of meaning: in other words, the object effectively serves some purpose, but it also serves to communicate information: we might sum it up by saying that there is always a meaning which overflows the object’s use.<sup id="fnref:24"><a href="#fn:24" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">24</a></sup></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>We can note the widespread use of the word “text” to characterize patterns of social phenomena not made of words or numerals, but there seems to have been relatively little attention to the overlap between semiotics and information science.<sup id="fnref:25"><a href="#fn:25" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">25</a></sup></p>

  <h2>Comments</h2>

  <p>One difference between the views of the documentalists discussed above and contemporary views is the emphasis that would now be placed on the social construction of meaning, on the viewer’s perception of the significance and evidential character of documents. “Relevance,” a central concept in information retrieval studies, is now generally considered to be situational and ascribed by the viewer. In semiotic terminology,</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>signs are never natural objects. . . . The reason is simply that the property of being a sign is not a natural property that can be searched for and found, but a property that is given to objects, be they natural or artificial, through the kind of use that is made of them. Both as objects and as means, signs have to be treated as something invented, and in this sense they are correlated to actions.<sup id="fnref:26"><a href="#fn:26" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">26</a></sup></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Briet’s notion of documents as evidence can occur in at least two ways. One purpose of information systems is to store and maintain access to whatever evidence has been cited as evidence of some assertion. Another approach is for the person in a position to organize artifacts, samples, specimens, texts, or other objects to consider what each could tell one about the world that produced it, and then, having developed some theory of its significance to place the object <em>in evidence</em>, to offer it as evidence by the way it is arranged, indexed, or presented. In this manner, information systems can be used not only in finding material that already is in evidence, but also in arranging material so that someone may be able to make use of it as (new) evidence for some purpose.<sup id="fnref:27"><a href="#fn:27" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">27</a></sup></p>

  <p>The evolving notion of “document” among Otlet, Briet, Schurmeyer, and the other documentalists increasingly emphasized whatever functioned as a document rather than traditional physical forms of documents. The shift to digital technology would seem to make this distinction even more important. Levy’s thoughtful analyses have shown that an emphasis on the technology of digital documents has impeded our understanding of digital documents as documents.<sup id="fnref:28"><a href="#fn:28" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">28</a></sup> A conventional document, such as a mail message or a technical report, exists physically in digital technology as a string of bits, but so does everything else in a digital environment. In this sense, any distinctiveness of a document as a physical form is further diminished, and discussion of “What is a digital document?” becomes even more problematic unless we remember the path of reasoning underlying the largely forgotten discussions of Otlet’s objects and Briet’s antelope.</p>

  <h2>Postscript: Documenting the Antelope</h2>

  <p>Briet’s discussion of an antelope as a document is quite specific: The antelope was from Africa; it was a newly discovered species; and it was brought to the Jardin des Plantes of the Muséum National d’Histoire Naturelle in Paris. Her account reads as if she were referring to an actual antelope known to her. In 1947, not long before Briet’s book appeared, the Muséum National d’Histoire Naturelle did announce the discovery of a new African antelope—<em>Tragelaphus scriptus reidae</em>, a subspecies of bushbuck — but there is no indication that a specimen was taken to Paris.<sup id="fnref:29"><a href="#fn:29" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">29</a></sup> The documentation of antelopes reveals that very few new species were discovered during Briet’s lifetime and documentary evidence of Briet’s antelope has eluded us. Appropriately, the word “antelope” itself, we found, is thought by some to derive from the Ethiopian word for the elusive unicorn.</p>
